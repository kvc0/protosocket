/// A `protosocket::Connection` is an IO driver. It directly uses tokio's io wrapper of mio to poll
/// the OS's io primitives, manages read and write buffers, and vends messages to & from connections.
/// Connections send messages to the ConnectionServer through an mpsc channel, and they receive
/// inbound messages via a reactor callback.
///
/// Protosockets are monomorphic messages: You can only have 1 kind of message per service.
/// The expected way to work with this is to use prost and protocol buffers to encode messages.
/// Of course you can do whatever you want, as the telnet example shows.
///
/// Protosocket messages are not opinionated about request & reply. If you are, you will need
/// to implement such a thing. This allows you freely choose whether you want to send
/// fire-&-forget messages sometimes; however it requires you to write your protocol's rules.
/// You get an inbound iterable of <MessageIn> batches and an outbound stream of <MessageOut> per
/// connection - you decide what those mean for you!
///
/// A ProtosocketServer is a future: You spawn it and it runs forever.
